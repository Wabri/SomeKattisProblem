# Bijele

Mirko has found an old chessboard and a set of pieces in his attic. Unfortunately, the set contains only white pieces, and apparently an incorrect number of them. A set of pieces should contain:

    One king

    One queen

    Two rooks

    Two bishops

    Two knights

    Eight pawns

Mirko would like to know how many pieces of each type he should add or remove to make a valid set.

## Input

The input consists of 6 integers on a single line, each between 0 and 10 (inclusive). The numbers are, in order, the numbers of kings, queens, rooks, bishops, knights and pawns in the set Mirko found.

## Output

Output should consist of 6 integers on a single line; the number of pieces of each type Mirko should add or remove. If a number is positive, Mirko needs to add that many pieces. If a number is negative, Mirko needs to remove pieces.

Sample Input 1
```
0 1 2 2 2 7
```
Sample Output 1
```
1 0 0 0 0 1
```

Sample Input 2
```
2 1 2 1 2 1
```
Sample Output 2
```
-1 0 0 1 0 7
```
