# Last Factorial Digit
The factorial of N, written as N!, is defined as the product of all the integers from 1 to N. For example, 3!=1×2×3=6.

This number can be very large, so instead of computing the entire product, just compute the last digit of N! (when N! is written in base 10).

## Input

The first line of input contains a positive integer 1≤T≤10, the number of test cases. Each of the next T lines contains a single positive integer N. N is at most 10.

## Output
For each value of N, print the last digit of N!.
