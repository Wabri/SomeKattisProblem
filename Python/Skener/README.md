Having solved the match issue, Mirko faced another challenging problem. His mom ordered him to read an article about the newest couples on the Croatian show-biz scene in the “Moja Tajna” magazine. The article is written in a very small font size which Mirko cannot read. Luckily, Mirko has a scanner in the closet which will enlarge the article for him.

The article is a matrix of characters with R rows and C columns. The characters are letters of the English alphabet, digits and the character ‘.’ (period). Mirko’s scanner supports two parameters, Z_R and Z_C. It substitutes each character it scans with a matrix of Z_ R rows and Z_ C columns, where all entries are equal to the scanned character.

Mirko realized his scanner’s software no longer works so he needs your help.

## Input

The first row contains four integers, R, C, Z_ R and Z_ C. R and C are between 1 and 50, while Z_R and Z_ C are between 1 and 5.

Each of the following R rows contains C characters each, representing the article from “Moja Tajna”.

## Output

The output should be a matrix of characters with R⋅ZRR \cdot Z_ R rows and C⋅ZCC \cdot Z_ C columns, the enlarged article.
